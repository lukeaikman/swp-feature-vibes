# Import Conventions

These patterns ensure find-and-replace works cleanly during integration into the main codebase.

## Do

- Import entity exports from the barrel: `from '../../entities/[module]'` (not individual files like `/api` or `/types`)
- Keep page-internal imports relative: `./components/MyComponent`
- Use exactly two levels of `../../` from pages to entities/types/routes — do not nest pages deeper

## Do Not

- NEVER import from `../../shims/` inside `entities/` or `pages/` — shims are only for `src/app/` and `src/App.tsx`
- NEVER import from `../../app/shell/` inside `entities/` or `pages/`

## Imports That Will Be Rewritten on Integration

| In this module | Becomes in main app |
|---|---|
| `from '../../entities/[module]'` | `from '@entities/[module]'` |
| `from '../../app/routes'` | `from '@app/routes'` |
| `from '../../types/common'` | `from '@api/common'` |
| `from '../../types/user'` | `from '@entities/user'` |

Imports from `@UI`, `@material-ui/core`, `@tanstack/*`, and `./components/` stay the same.

## Dependencies

When installing a new npm package:
1. Check if the main app already has it: search `safeworkplace-web-app/package.json`
2. Document it immediately in `COMPONENT-LOG.md` under "New Dependencies Added"

The `@app/format` shim only exports `getFullName`. For date formatting, use `date-fns` directly (already installed at v2.x — do not upgrade).
